 Just built a Quiz App with Flutter and Dart! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project, a Quiz App built using Flutter and Dart. 🎉

🔹 The Quiz App allows users to test their knowledge by answering a series of questions. It features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to navigate and interact with the app.

🔹 The app provides immediate feedback, highlighting the correct and incorrect answers. Users can check the number of questions they attempted correctly, review their selected answers, and compare them with the correct answers.

🔹 I added a restart button for users to start a new quiz session, making the app engaging and allowing users to challenge themselves repeatedly.

🔹 To enhance the app's visual appeal, I used Google Fonts to style the text, giving it a modern and professional look.

I had a great time developing this Quiz App and learned a lot about Flutter and Dart along the way. It's been an excellent opportunity to practice core concepts like state management, conditional rendering, and widget composition.

Check out the app in action and give it a try! 📱💡
